# PowershellTools
All the small Powershell scripts in one location

The collection is broken down into two parts

    1. Scripts - this are typically the single run scripts that are called 
                 from the command line to a single scheduled job
    2. Modules - these are add-ons that are required for multiple tasks
                 which can be run in an ad-hoc fashsion and are run as if 
                 they are cmdlets built into Powershell. To use they need to
                 be imported into the Powershell environment - Import-Module
